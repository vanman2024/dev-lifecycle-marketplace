## Recommendations

Based on the current sync status, here are the recommended next steps:

{{#if HIGH_SYNC}}
### High Sync Status ({{SYNC_PERCENTAGE}}% complete)

✓ **Excellent progress!** The project is well-aligned with specifications.

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete remaining {{PENDING_COUNT}} pending tasks
2. Review and close out in-progress items
3. Update documentation for completed features
4. Consider archiving completed specs

{{else if MODERATE_SYNC}}
### Moderate Sync Status ({{SYNC_PERCENTAGE}}% complete)

⚠ **Good progress, but attention needed**

**Next Steps:**
1. Focus on completing in-progress items ({{IN_PROGRESS_COUNT}} tasks)
2. Review pending tasks and prioritize ({{PENDING_COUNT}} tasks)
3. Address any blocking issues
4. Update spec status markers regularly

{{else}}
### Low Sync Status ({{SYNC_PERCENTAGE}}% complete)

✗ **Significant work needed to align specs with implementation**

**Next Steps:**
1. Conduct thorough review of all specifications
2. Update outdated or incorrect specs
3. Mark completed work that wasn't tracked
4. Create missing specs for implemented features
5. Establish regular sync schedule

## Appendix

### Report Methodology

This report was generated by analyzing:
- Specification markdown files in `{{SPEC_DIRECTORY}}`
- Code implementation in `{{CODE_DIRECTORY}}`
- Task completion markers (checkboxes: `- [x]`, `- [ ]`)
- Status frontmatter in spec files
- Code evidence (tests, implementations, configs)

### Evidence Scoring

Implementation evidence is scored based on:
- **Tests** (+2 points): Test files covering the feature
- **Implementation** (+1 point): Function/class definitions
- **Configuration** (+1 point): Config files or settings
- **Documentation** (+1 point): README or inline docs

Minimum evidence score for "likely complete": {{MIN_EVIDENCE_SCORE}}
